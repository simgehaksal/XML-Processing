# XML-Processing
The aim of this project is writing a program that provides a conversation between a database and an XML file. By doing this, I used Java Language. Java is one of the object-oriented languages. In other words, everything is an object.
The database part of the project was constituted on WampServer since refers to a software stack for the Microsoft Windows. WampServer is the best choice for MySQL database and PHP programming language. Also, I need phpMyAdmin to handle the administration of MySQL over the web because it supports a wide range of operations on MySQL. In this way, I could manage the database, tables, columns, relation, indexes, users, permissions and many other things.
To insert the XML file into the database by using a tree structure, I need to access the contents of the XML document. I could convert the value of one data type to a value of another data type by parsing, and the XML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating the XML document that I prepared. All XML elements can be accessed through the XML DOM. Thanks to the XML DOM, I could get, change, add, or delete XML elements. However, before an XML document can be accessed, it must be loaded into an XML DOM object. Shortly, I parsed a text string into an XML DOM object, and extract the information from it with JAVA.

I used three different techniques in this project successfully:
1. ADT, Parametric Types, Object Orientation
2. Concurrent Programming
3. Generic Programming
